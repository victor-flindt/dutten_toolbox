# dutten_toolbox
DTU toolboxes made by me throughout the years, mostly for exam preparation. 


This public repo is a gathering of exam preparation throughout my years at DTU.
The repo is publicly avaliable, but at own risk. 

If you have any notes for courses not in the repo that you would like to contribute please contact me. 

This repo is for building up a stronger intuition of "type exercises" and Algorithm implementation of such.
